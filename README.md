 <h3>Dataset</h3>
 <p1>The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.</p1>

 <h3>Description</h3>
 <p2>Naive Bayes Model is capable of identifying different species of the flower as respective classes.In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of linear "probabilistic classifiers" which assumes that the features are conditionally independent, given the target class. The strength (naivety) of this assumption is what gives the classifier its name. These classifiers are among the simplest Bayesian network models.Abstractly, naive Bayes is a conditional probability model as it assigns probabilities for each of the K possible outcomes or classes Ck,given a problem instance to be classified.
